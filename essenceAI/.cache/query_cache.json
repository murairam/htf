Many consumers associate plant-based products with off-flavours and a dry texture, while meat products are linked to meaty and umami flavours and a juicy texture.\n\n2. **Familiarity**: The level of familiarity with plant-based products can act as both a driver and a barrier to acceptance. Consumers who are habitual meat eaters may find it challenging to engage with novel plant-based options.\n\n3. **Labeling Conditions**: The way products are labeled can impact acceptability. For instance, closed label conditions tend to yield higher acceptability scores compared to open label conditions.\n\n4. **Consumer Concerns**: Factors such as animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and personal health concerns are significant drivers for consumers to consider plant-based diets.\n\n5. **Product Development**: There is a need for evidence-based product development to enhance the acceptability of plant-based meat alternatives, which can help in accelerating consumer adoption.\n\nThese factors collectively shape the consumer's willingness to embrace plant-based meat alternatives.", "citations": [{"source_id": 1, "file_name": "Flint_et_al._2025_meating_consumer_expectations_plant_based_meat_alternative_products", "page": "1", "relevance_score": 0.71, "excerpt": "Acceptability was measured on a nine-point hedonic scale and sensorial characterisation was determined via \ncheck-all-that-apply questioning.
