{"55d9048af90dc3acfc16d6108af2a142": {"answer": "Consumer acceptance of plant-based meat alternatives is influenced by several key factors, including:\n\n1. **Sensory Characteristics**: The taste, texture, and overall sensory experience of plant-based meat alternatives compared to meat-based products play a significant role. Many consumers associate plant-based products with off-flavours and a dry texture, while meat products are linked to meaty and umami flavours and a juicy texture.\n\n2. **Familiarity**: The level of familiarity with plant-based products can act as both a driver and a barrier to acceptance. Consumers who are habitual meat eaters may find it challenging to engage with novel plant-based options.\n\n3. **Labeling Conditions**: The way products are labeled can impact acceptability. For instance, closed label conditions tend to yield higher acceptability scores compared to open label conditions.\n\n4. **Consumer Concerns**: Factors such as animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and personal health concerns are significant drivers for consumers to consider plant-based diets.\n\n5. **Product Development**: There is a need for evidence-based product development to enhance the acceptability of plant-based meat alternatives, which can help in accelerating consumer adoption.\n\nThese factors collectively shape the consumer's willingness to embrace plant-based meat alternatives.", "citations": [{"source_id": 1, "file_name": "Flint_et_al._2025_meating_consumer_expectations_plant_based_meat_alternative_products", "page": "1", "relevance_score": 0.71, "excerpt": "Acceptability was measured on a nine-point hedonic scale and sensorial characterisation was determined via \ncheck-all-that-apply questioning.

The presence of a \"maybe\" option in surveys captures consumer hesitations, suggesting that addressing uncertainties can enhance acceptance. This highlights the importance of understanding consumer preferences and the psychological factors that affect their decision-making.\n\n2. **Recommended Messaging Approach**: Effective messaging should focus on the credibility of the product's benefits, particularly in relation to sustainability and health. Findings suggest that WTP can be sensitive to various influences, including the framing of information. Therefore, clear and compelling messaging that emphasizes the positive impact of lavie bacon on health and the environment can resonate well with consumers. Additionally, revealing information progressively can help maintain interest and trust.\n\n3. **Common Barriers Across All Sustainable Food Categories**: A significant barrier is the psychological bias towards mid-range prices, which can affect consumers' perceptions of value.
