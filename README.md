# 🌱 Plant-Based Packaging Intelligence

**AI-powered marketing & packaging analysis for plant-based food innovation**

---

## 🧠 Problem

Plant-based food companies face a high failure rate when launching new products:
- packaging does not clearly communicate value or utility,
- consumers distrust ultra-processed or “greenwashed” products,
- pricing is often misaligned with perceivedived benefits,
- go-to-market decisions (shelf placement, B2B targeting) rely on costly and slow market studies.

Early-stage startups and food innovators lack **fast, affordable, and science-informed tools** to evaluate how their products will be perceived **before** going to market.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Plant-Based Packaging Intelligence** is an AI-driven system that analyzes plant-based food products using:
- product identification data,
- packaging images,
- and business objectives provided by the company.

The system produces **interpretable scores** and a **strategic marketing analysis** tailored specifically to the plant-based food ecosystem.

---

## 🔌 Inputs

The solution takes **three complementary inputs**:

### 1️⃣ Product Identification
- Barcode (EAN / UPC)  
- Used to retrieve product metadata such as:
  - category,
  - ingredients,
  - nutritional information,
  - 
### 2️⃣ Packaging Image
- Front-of-pack or full packaging image
- Used to analyze:
  - visual attractiveness,
  - clarity of claims,
  - perceived naturality and trust,
  - alignment with plant-based consumer expectations.

### 3️⃣ Business Objective (Prompt)
A natural language prompt defined by the company, for example:
- *“Improve shelf attractiveness in retail”*
- *“Reduce perception of ultra-processed food”*
- *“Adapt packaging for B2B foodservice buyers”*

The objective guides score weighting and strategic recommendations.

## 🤖 System Architecture

The system is based on a **Multi-Agent AI (SMA)** architecture.

Each agent represents a specific expertise relevant to plant-based innovation:
- **Packaging & Visual Perception Agent**
- **Plant-Based Market & Consumer Agent**
- **Pricing & Positioning Agent**
- **Sustainability & Scientific Context Agent**

Agents can be connected to external plant-based–related knowledge sources (scientific literature, food databases, market reports) to ensure domain relevance and methodological clarity.

## 📊 Outputs

### 🎯 Product Scores

The system generates four main scores:

| Score | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Attractiveness Score** | Visual and emotional appeal of the packaging for targeted plant-based consumer segments |
| **Price Score** | Coherence between price, product promise, and market expectations |
| **Utility Score** | Perceived usefulness (nutrition, usage, clarity of benefits) |
| **Global Score** | Weighted synthesis aligned with the company’s objective |

All scores are designed to be **explainable and actionable**, not “black-box” indicators.

---

### 🧭 Strategic Analysis

In parallel, the system delivers a qualitative and strategic analysis covering:
- packaging strengths and weaknesses,
- potential shelf placement logic,
- B2B commercial positioning and buyer targeting,
- relevant consumer segmentation within the plant-based market,
- recommendations aligned with sustainability and credibility constraints.

---

### 💸 Economic Impact Estimation

The solution provides an estimated business impact, such as:
- reduced reliance on traditional consumer testing,
- fewer packaging iterations,
- faster time-to-market for new plant-based products.

These estimates are intended as **decision-support indicators**, not financial guarantees.

---
